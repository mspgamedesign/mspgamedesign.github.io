## Day 1: What is a game?! ##

*Supplies needed: laptops, paper, colored markers, whiteboard markers, pencils*

- Introductions (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Introduction to us
	- Make name tags
	- Individually fill out index cards (fill out again in session 9)
		- 1) name
		- 2) how do you define a game?
		- 3) list three games you like
		- 4) what part of game design are you most excited about?
		- 5) what part of game design are you least excited about?
	- Icebreaker (name game OR two truths and a lie)
	- Overview and Schedule
		- Write on whiteboard a general outline for the camp
		- Write on whiteboard what we will we cover today
		- We can ask some students to share their answers (from index cards) to what they are most/least excited about here
	- General classroom rules
		- Brainstorming the guidelines with the students
		- Write everything on the board
- What is a game? (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Definition
		- Have a few individuals read their definitions (from index cards) and we'll write them on the board
		- Many people will mention "fun": ask them what does fun even mean?
		- Additional prompt: How does a game differ from comics, movies, books, etc.?
	- What types of games exist?
		- Two whiteboard brainstorming exercises: brainstorming types of games ("genres") and then brainstorming what games can be about ("content").
			- Fighting, Shooter, Adventure, Role-playing, Strategy, Dance, Horror, Simulation, Sports, Puzzle, Platformer, Point-and-click, etc.
			- Portal 2: escape. Braid: epiphanies. Canabalt: speed. Angry Birds: slingshots. Minecraft: construction. Etc.
		- Goal: Games can be about anything and they don't have to be within a "genre"
	- Experimental games (also, playtime!)
		- Show off a large set of experimental games
		- Have students play 1-2 games on laptops
		- Discussion about their "content"
- How does a computer/game work? (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Logic statement exercise: "Play" as Mario
		- Supplies needed: Paper and markers 
		- Break into 4 groups of 6 students
		- In each group, each student will draw a different image on their paper
			- Role one: player; image: Nintendo controller
			- Role two: Mario; image: Mario's symbol
			- Role three: "if" statement about left/right arrow key; image: directional pad arrow 
			- Role four: "if" statement about the jump key; image: NES A Button
			- Role five: "then" statement about moving left/right; image: stick figure taking a step
			- Role six: "then" statement about jumping; image: stick figure jumping
		- Flow: Player presses a button, the "if" statements check the controller, the "then" statements listen to the "if" statements, the "then" statements tell Mario what to do
		- This exercise can be extended:
			- There can be a goal, e.g. getting to the flag
			- There could be a puzzle that two avatars need to solve
	- After the exercise, take a minute to reinforce the concepts that we learned
- Lunch (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Show a movie, show some video game trailers, play 7-Up, or set them loose into the cafeteria
- What does it take to make a game? (estimated duration: 30m)
	- Whiteboard brainstorming to ask what they think needs to go into a game
	- Then organize it into general categories, pull down some examples of the various categories and put them into a slideshow
		- Story
		- Art
		- Programming
		- Feedback & Playtesting
- Stencyl Introduction: Making a Nyan Cat platformer! (estimated duration: 2h30m)
	- Now that we've covered the general ideas behind game development, we can talk specifics
	- Goal: Reinforce the day's concepts through practice
	- Stencyl
		- What is Stencyl and why are we using it
			- Talk about various game engines and what they do
		- Anatomy of a Stencyl game
			- Explain: game, actor, background, tileset, sound, scene, behavior
	- Nyan Cat platformer 
		- Students get in groups (of 2-3) and hop on laptops
		- From loading assets to building a working level with tiles
			- Walk through step-by-step and make sure everyone keeps on the same page
		- Have each group build a level
			- Write down what you want the player to feel (frustration, speed, precision, rhythm, etc.)
			- Plan out the level on grid paper
			- Tweak gravity and velocity
			- Translate it to Stencyl
		- If there's time, play each other's levels
