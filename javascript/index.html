title: Choose Your Own Adventure
---
 
Using choose-your-own-adventure games as a model, students wrote JavaScript text games that require players to choose between possibilities to affect the game's outcome.  Students created short, branching stories on paper, with content ranging from stories about flying pig detectives to writing an essay for English class.  Then students worked with displaying their texts interactively in JavaScript.
