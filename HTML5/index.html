title: Exploratory Game
---

In the exploratory games, students used HTML and CSS to come up with an interactive site that allows players to navigate through a story only using hyperlinks.  All of the planning for the game was done on pencil and paper.  Pictures and text were handrawn by the student, and later, scanned into the computers.  The logic of the game was mapped out on paper in a giant flow chart.  After the planning, then the student learned to translate their drawings and flow charts into playable HTML games.
