Summers father was Alpha of Silver moon pack, Lord of shadow and wind his name was Niger, latin for black. He was a Wolf God, with a coat blacker than the darkest shadows that he fiercely ruled over. Summers mother was also a Wolf God, her name was Siderea, meaning stellar in Latin. Her coat was more enrapturing than all diamonds, the crystal white coat she had adorned rivaled the radiancy of the most divine star in the expansive cosmos that holds all that she rules over. As a result of her parents human forms Summer was born a human child but she also had wolf traits like her stronger senses and strength, along with a tail, ears and sharp canine fangs. She had dirty blonde hair the color of the sand that marked the edge of the beach at the lake where she learned to swim when she was young. Her eyes are the silver color of the full moon that hangs in the ebony sky which her mother rules over. Ever since she was 4 years of age her father made her be a warrior because he didnt have a son to be his heir and take his place, so he, in turn made her train in isolation having her come back only when she could pull off the moves and strategies he had taught her. She some times would get help from her friend Draco Gold and in return help him with his problems.");
