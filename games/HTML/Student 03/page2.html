<p id = "newid"> Its a beautiful day in your villige and you decide to go on a walk.
 your father is out in town and you're mother is at home.
  as you walk you hear a booming sound fowled by screams.
you run to your home to get your dager. as you run to town you see a large Dragon breathing fire and fighting off the towns guards.
 as you get closer you see your dad fighting the dragon as well. do you help your father or attack the Dragon.     </p>


<p id = "texthome"> As you run to your father the dragon hit you with his tail and you black out.You wake up in the towns hospital.
 the smell of burnt wood fells your lungs. The Doctor walks in and tells you your father died.
  Felled with anger you grab your dager and run away to find the Dragon that ended your fathers death.
 you come to a fork in the path, will you go left or right.
