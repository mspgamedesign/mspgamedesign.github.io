title: Platformer Game
---

2D platformer games were built using the <a href= "http://www.stencyl.com">Stencyl</a> game engine. Students started by designing their games using pencil and paper storyboards.  After presenting their designs to the class for feedback, students then worked in Photoshop to design their characters and their world before exporting them into Stencyl.  Finally, students added logic such as physics, controls, animation, triggers, etc. using Stencylâ€™s visual, drag-and-drop computer programming interface.

The code below loops through all the posts with a certain tag and inserts the appropriate HTML formatting for Kraken's grid to put everything neatly into a 3-column grid.
