<h2>Game Jams</h2>
<p>A game jam is an online or in-person gathering of people who commit to making a game in an extremely short period of time.  The goal isn't to produce a final product, but rather to work with what you know and experiment with turning ideas into prototypes.  Game jams are a great way to help focus you on getting to the core of an idea.  They are also a great way to meet people who make games and share your game with them.</p>
